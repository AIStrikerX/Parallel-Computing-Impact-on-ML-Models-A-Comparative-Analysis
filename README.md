# Parallel-Computing-Impact-on-ML-Models-A-Comparative-Analysis
 This project provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of how parallel computing affects the performance of various machine learning models. We systematically benchmark algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and a deep neural network on different hardware configurations, including multi-core CPUs and an NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU.
